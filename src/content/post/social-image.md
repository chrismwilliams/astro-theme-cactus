## Adding your own social image to a post

This post is an example of how to add a custom [open graph](https://ogp.me/) social image, also known as an OG image, to a blog post.
By adding the optional ogImage property to the frontmatter of a post, you opt out of [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) automatically generating an image for this page.

If you open this markdown file `src/content/post/social-image.md` you'll see the ogImage property set to an image which lives in the public folder[^1].

```yaml
ogImage: "/social-card.png"
```

You can view the one set for this template page [here](https://astro-cactus.chriswilliams.dev/social-card.png).

[^1]: The image itself can be located anywhere you like.
